# azure-scripts

A set of scripts I wrote to help me manage VMs in Microsoft Azure.

These scripts work on a Linux system running [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/). 

To install Azure CLI, see the instructions at: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Scripts ##

* [azruntime](https://github.com/blinklet/azure-scripts/tree/main/azruntime) -- displays a table of all VMs in your subscriptions, showing how long they have been in their current state.
