# azure-scripts

A set of scripts I wrote to help me manage VMs in Microsoft Azure.

These scripts work on a Linux system running [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/). 

To install Azure CLI, see the instructions at: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli

Terminal window width should be around 140 characters so the table displays without wrapping rows.
